### Future Work
So far we have only made the blog so that there is only the blog posts that we put in. Some future plans we though of implementing was allowing the users to actually create their own blog posts. Of course, this would take some work as we would need a server to store the info of the users and their posts. Some other ideas for the future was just in general fixing up the design of the blog, as we did not put too much work into styling the look of it.
